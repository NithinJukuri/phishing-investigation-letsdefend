📝 Overview

This case study documents a full phishing investigation performed on LetsDefend.
The incident involved an impersonating domain letsdefwnd.io targeting an employee.
The investigation includes:

Email analysis

Threat intelligence enrichment

OSINT validation

Browser & firewall log correlation

Endpoint inspection

IOC extraction

Containment & response

This demonstrates a complete Tier-1/Tier-2 SOC workflow.

🧾 Initial Log Alert (Starting Point)

The first alert originated from the CTI brand protection system:

Log Details
EventID: 304
Rule: SOC326 - Impersonating Domain MX Record Change Detected
Source: no-reply@cti-report.io
Destination: soc@letsdefend.io
Trigger Reason: MX record of suspicious domain changed
Domain: letsdefwnd[.]io
MX Record: mail.mailerhost[.]net
Action: Allowed

Interpretation

A domain similar to "letsdefend.io" had its MX records changed, a common precursor to phishing activity.

Domain resembled a typosquatting attack:
letsdefend.io → letsdefwnd.io

This signaled that attackers were preparing to send emails from this impersonating domain.

🚨 Incident Summary

Shortly after the CTI alert, a phishing email was delivered to employee Mateo:

From: voucher@letsdefwnd.io
Subject: "Congratulations! You've Won a Voucher"
URL: http://letsdefwnd.io/


The email used branding, social engineering, and a fraudulent voucher link.

🔍 Investigation Steps
1. Email Analysis

Sender domain was the same impersonating domain flagged earlier.

Email included a phishing link redirecting to letsdefwnd.io.

Email templates resembled standard phishing reward schemes.

Action: Identified as phishing — removed from mailbox.

2. Threat Intelligence Review

Using LetsDefend Threat Intel:

letsdefwnd.io tagged as phishing

Associated with multiple VPS IPs

Not owned by LetsDefend

Risk score elevated

VirusTotal Findings

Domain inactive at time of scan (likely taken down)

Previously associated with multiple Linode/Akamai cloud IPs

IP 45.33.23.183 flagged as malicious
(Criminal IP, Forcepoint ThreatSeeker, CyRadar)

3. OSINT & Reputation Checks

Tools used:

VirusTotal

URLscan.io

IPinfo

BrowserLeaks

WHOIS / DNS lookup

OSINT Outcome

Domain hosted on Linode/Akamai Cloud, commonly used for phishing kits

IP 45.33.23.183 appears in:

Malware reports

Security community warnings

Lists of suspicious VPS hosting clusters

This matched attacker infrastructure patterns.

🖥️ 4. Endpoint Investigation
Browser History (Key Evidence)
2024-09-18 13:32:13
http://www.letsdefwnd.io/


This confirms:

✔ The user clicked the phishing link
✔ The phishing domain was active during that time
Firewall Log Correlation

Two outbound HTTPS connections were recorded:

source_address: 172.16.17.162 (Mateo)
destination_address: 45.33.23.183
destination_port: 443

Importance

Destination IP is confirmed malicious

This validates that the endpoint successfully communicated with the attacker-controlled server

This eliminates the possibility of a false click or blocked attempt
→ actual connection was made

Process & Terminal Log Review

No execution of scripts (PowerShell, CMD, WScript, MSHTA)

No suspicious parent-child process behavior

No downloads (.exe, .zip, .js, .scr)

Conclusion

This was a credential phishing attempt, not a malware dropper.

🛡️ Containment & Response
Actions Taken

Deleted the phishing email

Added IOC entries:

letsdefwnd[.]io

45.33.23.183

mail.mailerhost.net

Blocked IP + domain in security layers

Contained the endpoint

Reset Mateo’s credentials

Terminated active sessions

User informed & trained

Verified no lateral movement or malware activity

📌 Indicators of Compromise (IOC)

Malicious URL

letsdefwnd[.]io


Malicious IP

45.33.23.183


Attacker MX Record

mail.mailerhost.net

📊 Final Conclusion

This was a confirmed phishing attack using an impersonating domain.
The user clicked the link, and the endpoint connected to a malicious server, but no malware was executed.

The incident was contained through:

IOC blocking

Endpoint containment

Credential reset

Email removal

User training

This investigation demonstrates:

✔ SOC Tier-1/Tier-2 investigation workflow
✔ Log correlation skills (email + endpoint + firewall)
✔ IOC extraction & threat intel enrichment
✔ OSINT analysis
✔ Incident containment & remediation
✔ Clear reporting and documentation
